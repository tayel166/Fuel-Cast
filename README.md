# ‚õΩ FuelCast IT ‚Äî Weekly Fuel Price Prediction (Italy)

**FuelCast IT** is a time-series forecasting project that predicts weekly fuel prices in Italy using multiple models and a robust preprocessing pipeline.  
This repository contains data preprocessing code, model implementations (Prophet, ARIMA, SARIMA, LSTM), evaluation scripts, and demonstrating results.

> This project focuses on improving forecasting accuracy by careful preprocessing (handling missing values, outliers, normalization, and decomposition).

## üìñ Project Overview

Fuel prices are volatile and influenced by seasonality, trends, and external events. FuelCast IT explores and compares four forecasting approaches:

- **Prophet** ‚Äî robust to missing data and good for multiple seasonalities.  
- **ARIMA** ‚Äî classical univariate model (AR, I, MA) for stationary series.  
- **SARIMA** ‚Äî ARIMA extended with seasonal terms.  
- **LSTM** ‚Äî deep learning model for non-linear, long-term dependencies.

The repository includes preprocessing routines to clean the data, handle outliers/missing values, normalize features, and decompose seasonal patterns before training models.
